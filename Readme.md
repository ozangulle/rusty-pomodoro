# Rusty Pomodoro

## Why another pomodoro app

First of all, it is a great opportunity to learn and practice Rust. Furthermore, I always wanted to be able to track and analyze my pomodoro habits. As far as I know, there is no open source application available which provides an on-site record of the process.

## Current Features

There is only one feature available right now:

- Follow the pomodoro cycle using the cli.

## Upcoming/Desired Features

- Logging the pomodoro process day by day in a file.
- Some kind of graphical interface at some point.

## How to use

There are no releases or binaries yet. You can get the source code and run `cargo run` or `rustc` in order to build the application.
