# Rusty Pomodoro [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ozangulle/rusty-pomodoro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ozangulle/rusty-pomodoro)

## Why another pomodoro app

First of all, it is a great opportunity to learn and practice Rust. Furthermore, I always wanted to be able to track and analyze my pomodoro habits. As far as I know, there is no open source application available which provides an on-site record of the process.

## Current Features

Current available features:

- Manage the pomodoro cycle using the terminal user interface.
- The app logs your pomodoro process day by day in a csv file.
- The app picks up the number of pomodoros from where you left if you run the app multiple times on a given day.

## Upcoming/Desired Features

- More control over the pomodoro process (pausing/stopping without exiting the app).
- Some kind of graphical interface at a later point.

## How to use

Simply get the binary for your system from "releases" and run it. rusty-pomodoro is currently a cli tool, so it will open the terminal to run.
